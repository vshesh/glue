# Markdown Introduction

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, *bold*, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

---list
this one
  that one
  the other one
yet another one
...

Note that lists are one example of an __environment__, and you will see many more of those coming up! The environment is begun with `---list` and ended with `...` on the last line.

---blockquote
Block quotes are
written like so.

They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.
...

##An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:


---list -o
first item
  first item
  second item
second item
third item
...

It's the same environment, but with an option attached (`-o`). Options look like the UNIX command-line, which can be a little unintuitive, but it forms a complete representation of the object.

Here is a different kind of environment - a code block:

---code bash
echo "Hello World!"
...

It's the same syntax for starting an environment, but this one is named "code" instead of "list". Again we passed an extra piece of information, this time the name of the programming language.

Here's another, with python as the language instead of bash:

---code python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
...



### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

---list -o
First, get these ingredients:
      carrots
      celery
      lentils
Boil some water
Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:

  find wooden spoon
  uncover pot
  stir
  cover pot
  balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
  wait 10 minutes
  goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.
...

Tables can look like this:

---matrix table
size | material |      color
9 |  leather  |     brown
10  | hemp canvas |   natural
11  |  glass     |    transparent
...

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomato.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in the katex environment:

---katex
I = \int \rho R^2dV
...

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
